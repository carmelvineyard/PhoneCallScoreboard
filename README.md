# PhoneCallScoreboard
### Simple micro-app to keep track of where my calls have gone today.

My car dealership suddenly got rather boring in Spring 2020. More stressful but with less business. My hours were cut at the reception desk and spread out over more days. I wanted to know when I was most needed to answer calls and on what days, so I began to keep track of how many calls I received for certain departments and even our sister dealerships. 

But I realized I was using a lot of scrap paper to write up the same form every day. This was repetitive, which naturally led to me coding a way to keep from repeating the task.

The result is my [Phone Call Scoreboard](https://carmelvineyard.github.io/PhoneCallScoreboard/index.html). My third "app so tiny it's just a local file". For this one, I made counters, labeled them, and implemented both increment and decrement buttons using vanilla JS and CSS. I once again picked colors with an eye for accessibility. Getting them properly spaced required use of an Actual HTML Table (**gasp**). 

There is still a lot of repetition in the code but the result has been easy to use. Which is nice as business has been picking back up. I'd love to figure out a function to grab each button and have both the increment and decrement buttons affect the same counter. But without jQuery, as this is still a work computer and I want to stay on the good side of our IT department.
